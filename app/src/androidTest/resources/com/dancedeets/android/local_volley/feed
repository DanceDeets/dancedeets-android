    "description":"Arrhythmia Dance Company is hosting its 4th Annual convention on November 9, 2014 from 11:00am-3:30pm\nThere are 3 different styles of dance at this year's convention: Contemporary, Tap and Street Jazz taught by some of the best in the industry! \n\nKyle Rostan - Contemporary\nKaelyn Gray - Tap\nCarmelo Cruz - Street Jazz\n\nThe cost of the convention is $75 online and $80 at the door. Make sure to secure your spot as there are only 40 people allowed in each level!\n\n\nMeet our teachers below! \nKyle Rostan began dancing in high school, at a competitive dance studio under the instruction of Rose Taylor in Youngstown, Ohio. He attended Point Park University with a concentration in Jazz and Choreography. While at Point Park, Kyle had the honor of performing as a soloist in Cinderella; The Ballet, Bob Fosse\u2019s Sing Sing Sing, Susan Stroman\u2019s CONTACT, and Agnes DeMille\u2019s Rodeo, to name a few. Kyle has worked for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, and performed with Neil Young, Aaron Carter, and continues to perform and choreograph for Athena Reich, international Lady Gaga Impersonator. New York Credits Include; BodyArt Dance Co, Flexicurve, Kim Gibilisco Dances, Bawdy: Off-Broadway Cabaret, Sticky Mango Movement, House of Yes, and DAMAGEDANCE, where he is a founding member. He has worked as a stage manager and lighting designer, holds certifications in Pilates, and Aerial Arts, and has a minor in Art History. He currently judges dance competitions, and teaches at The Pulse Performing Arts Center in Bedford Hills NY, as well as many other studios throughout the country. \n\n\nKaelyn Gray is a full-time tap choreographer and master instructor whose teaching and enthusiasm has taken her all over the country.  She has been mentored by Chris Erk, an original member of Tap Dogs, as well as Gregg Russell who has been instrumental in her current training.  She was an original member of Chris Erk\u2019s tap company Tap Factor and has performed alongside Jumanne Taylor and Anthony Russo, to name a few. In the Summer of 2013, Kaelyn was offered to be a part of the faculty at the \u201cLA Tap Experience\u201d, a week-long intensive featuring artists such as Maud Arnold, Sarah Reich, Rod Howell, Angie Carter, and Ryan Lohoff.  The week ended with a performance at LA Theatre Downtown featuring Tap Sounds Underground, founded by Gregg Russell.  She was also an assistant at the Annual Dance Teachers Summit held in NYC in the Summer of 2011. Most recently, Kaelyn has started her own tap company, ProtoTap, along with fellow tapper/hoofer Parker Hall of NYC.  With this company they hope to reach their long-time goal of providing tap education to the under-privileged through community outreach. Kaelyn teaches full-time at Expressions Dance Theatre in the styles of Tap, Hip Hop, Jazz, Jazz Funk, and Lyrical/Contemporary.  Her choreography has been recognized regionally and nationally, and her students have gone on to work in film and television, on cruise ships, in college dance programs, and in professional companies.",

The Brooklyn-based dance trio Tortured Soul isn\u2019t trying to intently rewrite the logic of today\u2019s EDM with the sweat of their own musicianship, but they are living proof that the very same music can be freed from the DJ booth. Influenced by the classic songcraft of Prince, Heatwave and Kool & The Gang, the members of Tortured Soul are three distinctive guys with three different backgrounds, united under a groove-centered rhythm. The band\u2019s frontman and principal songwriter, John-Christian Urich, can be seen simultaneously drumming and singing with effortless mastery, while the rest of the collective, made up of keyboardist Ethan White and bassist Jordan Scannella, virtuosically generate the pulsating accompaniment. It\u2019s a striking visual that\u2019s feverishly winning converts with each and every tour stop, with them being likened to The Roots of house music. Inside the group\u2019s mystique, the acid jazz is reminiscent of Jamiroquai funk, while deeply saturated in the contemporary freshness of house purveyors like Joey Negro, Kenny Dope, Soul Clap and Jamie Jones. Even the legendary tastemaker Gilles Peterson, dubbed them \u201cthe future of house music.\u201d\n\n------------------\n\nNo Wahala DJs (DJ Quesquecest? & DJ Chibuikem, NYC)\n \nhttps://www.facebook.com/NoWahalaDJs\nhttps://twitter.com/noWahalaDJs\n \nNYC's colorful DJ crew, No Wahala DJs are DJ Chibuikem & DJ Quesquecest? whose monthly #UNWIND dancefloor sessions are one of the hottest parties in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn and are a marathon of reggae, dub, afrobeat, hiphop, breaks & deep bass.\n \nTaking their name from a West African English slang for \"No Problem\" or \"No Trouble,\" No Wahala DJ are keenly attuned to the needs of the dancefloor.
